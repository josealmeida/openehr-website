		<h1>Governance & Members</h1>
		
		<p>Most current openEHR-related software projects are self-governed sparate entities. The 
		   principles below only govern the common openEHR Software Programme itself and it's 
		   provided resources (sometimes including code donated to the openEHR foundation). 
		</p>
		
		<p>The governance structure of the openEHR software program/group is mosly mail-list based
		   and inspired by the <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/">Apache Software Foundation</a>
		   and <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#management">the way it works</a>.
		   That is combined with the <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/openehrfoundation.org/foundation/home/foundation-committees">general
		   governance structure of the openEHR foundation</a> that requires both a <em>Program Committee</em> and 
		   a list of <em>Program Qualified Members</em>.</p>
		
		<h2>Community, including Program Qualified Members</h2>
		
		<p>The majority of the work and software decisions should be discussed on the 
		   <a href="/community/mailinglists.php">openehr-implementers mailing list</a>
		   where anybody can contribute to the concensus-targeted discussion (no qualified membership required).
		</p>

		<p>If voting is needed then
		   votes from <em>Program Qualified Members</em> will be evaluated using <a 
		   href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html"> Apache style voting and interpretation</a>.
		</p>

		<p>Qualified Membership should be based on meritocracy and willingness to contribute. 
		   Qualified Membership is not time-limited. Qualified Membership can be ended if the 
		   member requests to be removed.
		</p> 

		<p>If three independent* <em>Qualified Members</em> agree to suggest a 
		   new member and presents the candidate (including openEHR related merits), 
		   then the <em>Program Committee</em> should discuss and consider if the 
		   new member should be: 
		   a) approved at present or 
		   b) be recommended  to first gain more experience in order to get suggested again later. 
		</p> 

		<p>If thorny vendor/institution-related issues arise that at least three independent*
		   Qualified Members think would benefit from vendor/institution balance, then the issue
		   can be transferred to the program committee instead.
		</p>
		 
		<p>*) Independent in this case refers to not being dependent on the same organisation 
			for salary or other benefits.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Current Program Qualified Members</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>David Moner</li>
			<li>Diego Bosc√°</li>
			<li>Erik Sundvall (coordinator)</li>
			<li>Heath Frankel</li>
			<li>Heather Leslie</li>
			<li>Koray Atalag</li>
			<li>Pablo Pazos</li>
			<li>Ricardo Correia</li>
			<li>Rong Chen</li>
			<li>Sam Heard</li>
			<li>Seref Arikan</li>
			<li>Sergio Freire</li>
			<li>Shinji Kobayashi</li>
			<li>Thomas Beale</li>
			<li>Tony Shannon</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h2>Program Committee</h2>
		
		<p>The <em>Program Committee</em> is responsible for reporting to and relating to the openEHR foundation board
		and it also maintains the official (and incubating) openEHR software project listings and approves new 
		<em>Program Qualified Member</em> suggestions (as described above).	
		</p>

		<p> The <em>Program Committee</em> is according to openEHR foundation 
			<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/openehrfoundation.org/foundation/home/foundation-committees">program rules</a>
			limited to a maximum of 9 and minimum of 5 Qualified Members. During initial/bootstrap committee formation we have strived
			to set it up in a way so that no specific company or institution is represented more than
			once (since the number of seats is limited).
		</p>
		
		<p> The <em>Program Committee</em> positions should be renewed or changed on a regular basis 
			as decided by the openEHR foundation. The <em>Software Program Qualified Members</em> suggest 
			new and/or renewed positions in the <em>Software Program Committee</em> to the openEHR foundation
			board that does final approval (or asks the <em>Software Program Qualified Members</em> for a new suggestion).
		</p>
